# IpTracer
IpTreacer is a **Django-based** web application that allows you to track and analyze IP addresses using public geolocation and network analysis APIs. The application is designed to provide detailed information about the approximate location and technical characteristics of an IP address, facilitating monitoring, auditing, cybersecurity, and traffic analysis.

Through a simple interface, users can query IP addresses and obtain data such as:

- *Country, region, and city*
- *Internet Service Provider (ISP)*
- *Connection type*
- *Approximate geographic coordinates*
- *Network information relevant to technical analysis*

IpTreacer integrates multiple public APIs to improve the reliability of the results and is intended as an educational and support tool for developers, system administrators, and cybersecurity professionals.

⚠️ Note: The information provided depends on the public APIs used and may not be 100% accurate. The application does not perform physical tracking or invade user privacy.
